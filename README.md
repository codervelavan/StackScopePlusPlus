# 📐 StackScope++  
**AI-Powered Physics & Math Expression Evaluator using C++ and CERN ROOT**

> An intelligent scientific agent that converts natural language problems into symbolic expressions, evaluates them using a stack-based C++ engine, and visualizes computation with ROOT.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 Natural language to math/physics expression (Python NLP)
- ⚙️ Custom infix-to-postfix and postfix evaluator (C++)
- 📊 ROOT visualization of stack traces and evaluation steps
- 🧪 CLI-based testing and modular codebase

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- `C++17`: Stack, Parser, Evaluator
- `Python 3.x`: NLP using `spaCy` or `regex`
- `ROOT`: Tree visualization, data plotting
- `Git + Makefile`: Build and version control

🔹 Run an Expression:
bash
Copy
Edit
./build/evaluate "3 + 4 * (2 - 1)"
🔹 Run AI Parser (Coming Soon):
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 ai/parse.py "Calculate potential energy when m = 2, g = 9.8, h = 10"
🔹 Generate ROOT Plot (Coming Soon):
bash
Copy
Edit
root root_plots/plot_stack.C

🧠 Inspiration
This project is inspired by:

Agentic AI tools from 500 AI Agents

Educational needs in physics and engineering

Scientific computing practices at CERN
📌 Project Goals
✅ Build a solid stack-based evaluator in C++

✅ Enable AI-driven expression parsing from physics problems

✅ Visualize computation using ROOT (tree + stack animation)

✅ Combine DSA, NLP, and scientific computing into one tool
